Introduction"],"metadata":{"id":"3yMwD7t3jAut"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["They key job for Data engineering lies under the word 'enegineering', which basically means design and build things (Black,2023). Thus, data engineers accomplish the same task, by designing and building pipelines, e.g ETL, to transform and transport data from diverse range of sources to either Data Scientists or other end users. In the past few decades, there has been substantial increase in data volume, thus, requirements to split job in teams to achieve the task. Consequently, several technologies was established to achieve this purpose, including Apache Hadoop, AWS, Apache Hive and currently most-used Apache Spark (Wilson,2021). Thus, the approach for this assignment was established to ensure that the same code can be accessed by a team of users, despite the assignment was an individual one. \n","\n","World Bank Group (2021) has emphasised again the importance of anti-corruption in a country, as corruption has a detrimental impact on the poor and most vulnerable citizens in the country, in the dimensions of health, finance, education and justice. Similarlt, United Nations (2004) also emphaised that corruption distort markets, allow organised crime, democracy and rule of law in the country, which consequently will have an impact on citizen's life, especially the poor citizens. Thus, the research will be focused on finding the relationship between corruption and some singificant development indicators.\n","\n","In order to achieve this objective, I have obtained one dataset, through web scrapping, from transparency International, which offers the top 100 countries' corruption rank and scores. I have also retreieved 6 other datasets from the World Bank, which gained insights on how corruption score or rank is related to development indicators, such as rule of law or government effectiveness. Consequently, data analysis, such as regression can be used to predict corruption rank or score by using these indicators. "],"metadata":{"id":"gJOZwFwnzD5u"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2. Structure"],"metadata":{"id":"_gUxlzr7jERq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.1 Data Storage\n","To make the data storage more manageable and efficient, parquet format is used after each dataset is retrieved from its source. Parquet is an open and free source file format that supports complex data types, which enables data engineers to store diverse range of data in the parquet format, such as image, documents or structured table (Databrick, 2023). Moreover, parquet formatis also good for storing big data, to overcome the challenge of server capcity, when large volumes of data is retrieved from many sources. Consequently, it reduces the high storage costs associated with large volume of data. Thus, the free parquet format should be adopted as widely as possible for both organisations and individuals to manage large volume of data efficiently, while making the storage more affordable.\n","\n","As data will continue to grow annually, a structured schema is designed for the relational database to enhance management efficiency. The structured schema contains 6 different world development indicators, a corruption-score table and a country-related information table for referencing purpose. The design for the structure allows us to extract and analyse the information more efficiently. For example, if we want to find the underlying reasons of the movement in corruption rank or score for a country, the 'indicator' table can quickly identifies the change in each of the 6 development indicators across years, then, general relationship can be deduced. In addition, if we would like to assess the general time-effect(co-variates) on corruption score, the 'corruption' table will offer general insights on year-based general trends for top 100 countries, which can be incorporated into analysis of corruption and indicators. \n","\n","For the ease of database management, a DB digram is drawn to visualise the structured schema for later research purpose with more data."],"metadata":{"id":"cdsEvXGiBnkx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.2 Source Version Control"],"metadata":{"id":"XwUaIG8Wlrrg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Although this is an individual assignment, with no teamwork is required, source version control(SVC) is a good practice to ensure that changes in this notebook can be tracked and noted, in case I would like to revise changes at a later date.

It includes basic information about a country's rank, corruption score, year corresponded and country name. Thus, from the perspective of preliminary data analysis, we could monitor the change in corruption rank and score resepctively. Meanwhile, from practical utility, the dataset provides the focal countries, top 100 least-corrupted countries, which can lead to further analysis into underlying feeatures that mitigate corruption in those countries. Currently, the data only included corruption ranking from 2017-2022, to minimise processing cost at low machine power. Nonetheless, the data is available from the year 1995 to 2022, on Transparency International website, which can be esaily obtained through the applied webscrapping code.

Firstly, the two main data source is from the 'Transparency International Organisation' and 'Worldbank', in which more datasource may be inocrporated into the database, especially corruption statistics in LMICs (Low-income/Mid-income countries). The comparison of development indicators between more developed countries and LMICs, may yield greater insights of the relationship between corruption and development. Secondly, due to the resource limitation, corruption and development data from the past 5 years (since 2017) are selected, whereas the data source offers more extensive historical data (from 1998). Thus, if more historical data is incorporated, time-series analysis of corruption and development may be more informative. Thirdly, from a practical perspective, the current sql database,on Microsoft Azure, is not properly equipped with full functionalities, such as it only has 1 V-core and has a maximum data size of 21GB. This is due to the higher cost associated with a more robust sql database. Although the setting is efficient for current use, later adjustment is needed once the dataset is scaled. Fourthly, the firewall rules associated with the sql database is not succinctly written with constant IP address, which should be done if a user wants to access the database through a staionary network address. The reason that firewall rules are not properly written currently is due to the ever-changing IP address of Google Colab.
