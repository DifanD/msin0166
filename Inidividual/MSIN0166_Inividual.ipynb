Introduction"],"metadata":{"id":"3yMwD7t3jAut"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The key job for Data engineering lies under the word 'engineering', which basically means design and build things (Black,2023). Thus, data engineers accomplish the same task, by designing and building pipelines, e.g ETL, to transform and transport data from a diverse range of sources to either Data Scientists or other end users. In the past few decades, there has been substantial increase in data volume, thus, requirements to split jobs in teams to achieve the task. Consequently, several technologies were established to achieve this purpose, including Apache Hadoop, AWS, Apache Hive and currently most-used Apache Spark (Wilson,2021). Thus, the approach for this assignment was established to ensure that the same code can be accessed by a team of users, despite the assignment being an individual one.\n","World Bank Group (2021) has emphasised again the importance of anti-corruption in a country, as corruption has a detrimental impact on the poor and most vulnerable citizens in the country, in the dimensions of health, finance, education and justice. Similarly, the United Nations (2004) also emphasized that corruption distorts markets, allows organised crime, democracy and rule of law in the country, which consequently will have an impact on citizen's life, especially the poor citizens. Thus, the research will be focused on finding the relationship between corruption and some singificant development indicators.\n","In order to achieve this objective, I have obtained one dataset, through web scraping, from transparency International, which offers the top 100 countries' corruption rank and scores. I have also retrieved 6 other data sets from the World Bank, which gained insights on how corruption score or rank is related to development indicators, such as rule of law or government effectiveness. Consequently, data analysis, such as regression can be used to predict corruption rank or score by using these indicators.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"gJOZwFwnzD5u"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 2. Structure"],"metadata":{"id":"_gUxlzr7jERq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.1 Data Storage\n","To make the data storage more manageable and efficient, parquet format is used after each dataset is retrieved from its source. Parquet is an open and free source file format that supports complex data types, which enables data engineers to store a diverse range of data in the parquet format, such as image, documents or structured table (Databrick, 2023). Moreover, parquet format is also good for storing big data, to overcome the challenge of server capacity, when large volumes of data are retrieved from many sources. Consequently, it reduces the high storage costs associated with large volumes of data. Thus, the free parquet format should be adopted as widely as possible for both organisations and individuals to manage large volumes of data efficiently, while making the storage more affordable.\n","As data will continue to grow annually, a structured schema is designed for the relational database to enhance management efficiency. The structured schema contains 6 different world development indicators, a corruption-score table and a country-related information table for referencing purposes. The design for the structure allows us to extract and analyse the information more efficiently. For example, if we want to find the underlying reasons of the movement in corruption rank or score for a country, the 'indicator' table can quickly identify the change in each of the 6 development indicators across years, then, general relationship can be deduced. In addition, if we would like to assess the general time-effect(covariates) on corruption score, the 'corruption' table will offer general insights on year-based general trends for top 100 countries, which can be incorporated into analysis of corruption and indicators.\n","For the ease of database management, a DB diagram is drawn to visualise the structured schema for later research purposes with more data.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cdsEvXGiBnkx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.2 Source Version Control"],"metadata":{"id":"XwUaIG8Wlrrg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Although this is an individual assignment, with no teamwork is required, source version control(SVC) is a good practice to ensure that changes in this notebook can be tracked and noted, in case I would like to revise changes at a later date. Source version control basically records the evolution of codes. Git is an open-source tool for the SVC management, which can be easily integrated with Github for teamwork when necessary. Each time I have completed a version of notebook, I will then add, committ and push the change into my personal Github to track the changes. A screenshot of code to perform the aformentioned tasks is attached. Nonetheless, it has to be noted that Google colab has Git already installed, meaning that it already offers an in-built SVC, which is readily available under tab 'file'>'revision

Firstly, the two main data source is from the 'Transparency International Organisation' and 'Worldbank', in which more datasource may be inocrporated into the database, especially corruption statistics in LMICs (Low-income/Mid-income countries). The comparison of development indicators between more developed countries and LMICs, may yield greater insights of the relationship between corruption and development. \n","\n","Secondly, due to the resource limitation, corruption and development data from the past 5 years (since 2017) are selected, whereas the data source offers more extensive historical data (from 1998). Thus, if more historical data is incorporated, time-series analysis of corruption and development may be more informative. \n","\n","Thirdly, from a practical perspective, the current sql database,on AWS RDS, is not properly equipped with full functionalities and security setting. Firstly, current database is limited to 2 Vcore and 1GB RAM, with a maxmium capacity of 250GB. The setting may be suitable for smaller dataset, but may be insufficient for more complex operations such as video editing or live photo processing (Becker,2009). Secondly, current inbound and outbound rule is set at port 0.0.0.0/0, meaning that it is publicly accessible through any device with correct user identification information, which might be leaked esaily. The reason that security rules are not properly written currently is due to the ever-changing IP address of Google Colab, meaning that no fixed IP address can be set as a user for the database. Later imporvements can be made by assinging IAM roles, two-factor security check, and switching off public accessibility, while assigning frequent users to the database.\n","\n","Lastly, data version control can also be improved by automating the github push notebook. Currently, I manually push the updated notebook, through github bash. To simplify the process, automating the notebook will alleviate the need to do so.

More specifically, two categories of datasets were obtained from two sources. Corruption data is webscraped from the International Transparency organisaiton, containing top 100 countries' corruption rank and score. Development indicators were obtained from World Bank open API, which were matched against the countries in the corruption dataset. Although there is limited countries and year (top 100 countries and past 5 years of data), there are already more than 3400 datapoints, which can be used for model training purposes.\n","\n","During the process, data version control has been implmeneted through the use of Git and Github, with Git bash to push the updated notebook into the github resporitory. The reason to use github is for transparency purposes, such that other users may access the resporitory and develop upon the code, after the coursework is due.
